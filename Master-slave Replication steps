Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to set up MySQL master-slave replication:

1. Prepare the Master:

   a. Edit the MySQL configuration file (my.cnf) on the master:
      ```
      sudo vim /etc/mysql/my.cnf
      ```

   b. Add or modify these lines in the [mysqld] section:
      ```
      server-id = 1
      log_bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
      binlog_do_db = your_database_name
      ```

   c. Restart MySQL:
      ```
      sudo systemctl restart mysql
      ```

   d. Log into MySQL and create a replication user:
      ```sql
      CREATE USER 'repl_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
      GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repl_user'@'%';
      FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
      ```

   e. Lock tables and get binary log position:
      ```sql
      FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
      SHOW MASTER STATUS;
      ```
      Note down the File and Position values.

2. Prepare the Slave:

   a. Edit the MySQL configuration file on the slave:
      ```
      sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
      ```

   b. Add or modify these lines in the [mysqld] section:
      ```
      server-id = 2
      relay-log = /var/log/mysql/mysql-relay-bin.log
      ```

   c. Restart MySQL on the slave:
      ```
      sudo systemctl restart mysql
      ```

3. Copy Data from Master to Slave:

   a. On the master, dump the database:
      ```
      mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases --master-data > dbdump.sql
      ```

   b. Transfer the dump file to the slave:
      ```
      scp dbdump.sql user@slave_ip:/tmp/
      ```

   c. On the slave, import the dump:
      ```
      mysql -u root -p < /tmp/dbdump.sql
      ```

4. Configure the Slave:

   a. On the slave, start the replication:
      ```sql
      CHANGE MASTER TO
      MASTER_HOST='master_ip',
      MASTER_USER='repl_user',
      MASTER_PASSWORD='password',
      MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.000001',
      MASTER_LOG_POS=123;
      ```
      Replace 'master_ip' with the actual IP, and use the File and Position values noted earlier.

   b. Start the slave:
      ```sql
      START SLAVE;
      ```

   c. Check slave status:
      ```sql
      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G
      ```
      Look for "Slave_IO_Running" and "Slave_SQL_Running" to be "Yes".

5. Unlock Tables on Master:

   a. On the master, unlock the tables:
      ```sql
      UNLOCK TABLES;
      ```

6. Verify Replication:

   a. Make changes on the master and verify they appear on the slave.

7. Monitor Replication:

   a. Regularly check slave status:
      ```sql
      SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G
      ```

   b. Monitor for any replication errors or lag.

Remember to replace placeholder values (like 'your_database_name', 'password', 'master_ip', etc.) with your actual values. Also, ensure that firewall settings allow MySQL traffic between the master and slave servers.

This setup provides a basic master-slave replication. For production environments, consider additional factors like SSL encryption for replication traffic, semi-synchronous replication, or more advanced topologies like multi-source replication.
